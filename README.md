            <h1>Machine Learning Model</h1>
            <p>The primary machine learning model used is the Isolation Forest algorithm, which excels in anomaly detection. This section outlines the usage, training, and prediction processes for the machine learning components.</p>
            <h2>Training the Machine Learning Model</h2>
            <h3>Data Collection</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Historical Transaction Data:</strong> Collect historical transaction data including features such as transaction amount, timestamp, location, merchant details, and user information.</li>
                <li><strong>Labeling Data:</strong> For supervised algorithms, label the data to indicate whether each transaction is legitimate or fraudulent.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Data Preprocessing</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and correct any inconsistencies in the data.</li>
                <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Create new features or modify existing ones to improve the model's predictive power (e.g., transaction frequency, average transaction amount).</li>
                <li><strong>Normalization:</strong> Scale the features to a standard range to ensure the model's performance is not biased by the scale of the input data.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Training the Isolation Forest Model</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Isolation Forest:</strong> An unsupervised learning algorithm specifically designed for anomaly detection. Ideal for identifying fraudulent transactions by isolating anomalies from the normal transaction patterns.</li>
